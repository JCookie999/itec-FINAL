            <h2>Possible Solutions to E-Waste</h2>
            <p>
                Addressing the growing issue of electronic waste requires a combination of individual, corporate, and governmental efforts. Here are some possible solutions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    *Recycling Programs: Encourage and participate in e-waste recycling programs to properly dispose of electronic devices. Many components of electronics can be reused or safely recycled.
                </li>
                <li>
                    *Extended Producer Responsibility: Manufacturers should be required to take responsibility for the lifecycle of their products, including collection and recycling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    *Repair and Reuse: Promote a culture of repairing electronics rather than discarding them. Consider donating working devices to those in need.
                </li>
                <li>
                    *Legislation and Policies: Governments can implement policies to regulate e-waste disposal and mandate sustainable design practices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    *Consumer Awareness: Educate individuals about the importance of reducing e-waste and adopting sustainable practices, such as purchasing refurbished electronics.
                </li>
            </ul>
